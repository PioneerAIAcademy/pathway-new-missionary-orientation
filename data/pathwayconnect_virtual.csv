S2,"What kind of students might benefit most from BYU-Pathway's educational structure?",text,"BYU-Pathway Worldwide is for students around the globe who want a flexible, affordable, faith-centered approach to higher education — especially those who might otherwise lack access to college-level learning or who need to balance schooling with life's other demands.

Unemployed or underemployed individuals — BYU-Pathway can help members earn job-ready certificates and/or a degree to establish or transition into a career.

Less active individuals and families — BYU-Pathway helps less active members reconnect to the gospel and make friends in their area by providing spiritual growth opportunities and fellowshipping.

Young adults — BYU-Pathway's gospel-centered courses and institute requirements can be a source of strength and direction.

Mothers with young families — BYU-Pathway's flexible homework options, and Gathering time offerings make it easier for a busy mom to be able to work around family schedules and complete her educational goals.

Returned missionaries — BYU-Pathway can help returned missionaries continue to be involved in the gospel while getting an education and progressing toward a family and career.

Recent Converts — Newly baptized members have opportunities to progress and fellowship, making it more likely that they'll stay active.

Friends of the Church — Many individuals who are not members of the Church gain a testimony through BYU-Pathway's courses and eventually join the Church.

Non-native English speakers — BYU-Pathway provides tools for improving English skills and professional communication.

Those who can't travel to a campus — BYU-Pathway can be an excellent resource for those who want to start or complete a degree, but can't attend a Church-university campus either because of distance, job, family responsibilities, or cost.","Compare Missionary Answer with Correct Response and: reinforce concepts in the missionary's response that match the Correct Response; provide the concepts the missionary didn't have in their answer.",,,,,S3,no
